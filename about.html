    <h1>Hai this is Karthik Chittimalla</h1>
    <p class="para">My highest degree is a full time B.Tech/B.E. in Computers from Gokaraju Rangaraju Institute of Engineering and Technology, Hyderabad that will complete in May-2023. My Percentage is 83.
        My Computers degree(s) is giving a range of skills that I feel are crucial for my career and life. Despite limited exposure, I have understood that hard work and determination can make anything possible. I am ready to do that. Also, I am trying to develop a habit of reading current trends and industry news.
        When it comes to schooling, I secured 86.16% in my XIIth Other Senior Secondary examination in 2020 in Other medium. In Xth Other Board, I got 87.0%. During my schooling, I developed strong communication skills and also had the opportunity to participate and excel in several extracurricular activities. Because of these exposures and experiences during my academic years, I have gradually been able to develop effective communication skills. So, I can interact freely within a team.
        Lastly, I am a quick learner and believe in learning from my past mistakes. This is a virtue as it can take me ahead in both my professional and personal life.</p>
